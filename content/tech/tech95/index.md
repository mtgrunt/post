How to Use Claude and How It Differs from ChatGPT?

Anthropic's Claude chatbot, equipped with the latest real-time data, offers unique features and accessibility options. The recent update to Claude 3.5, released in June 2024, distinguishes it from other AI chatbots with its advanced functionality. This version can process up to 200,000 words in a single instance, making it particularly useful for summarizing extensive documents, transcripts and other large texts. Users can upload various file types, such as PDFs, DOCX and CSVs. Also summarize web pages and address specific data inquiries. Its real-time data training enables it to provide current information on events and topics.

Claude 3.5 is available via its website, iOS app and Slack integration, allowing users to interact. Additionally, how to ask questions, retry for improved answers and manager past conversations. The platform supports summarizing web pages and uploaded files, with options for rating responses and giving feedback. This updated version is designed to offer a more refined and efficient user experience compared to other AI chatbots.

Can Claude Bypass a Paywall?
Paywalls are systems that restrict access to content behind a subscription or payment requirement. Claude, like other AI tools, cannot bypass these paywalls. However, it can assist with tasks related to web development. For example, if you need to remove a broken model from a webpage, Claude can help by providing JavaScript code. 

Hereâ€™s a sample code snippet to remove a modal from a webpage:
    
    function removeModal() {
        // Find the modal element
        const modal = document.getElementById('modal-OVERLAPABLE');

        // If the modal exists, remove it
        if (modal) {
            modal.remove();
        }

        // Also remove any modal-related classes
        document.body.classList.remove('modal-open');

        // Restore scrolling if it was disabled
        document.body.style.overflow = 'initial';
    }

    // Run the function when the DOM is fully loaded
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', removeModal);

    // Also run it immediately in case the DOM has already loaded
    removeModal();

Bob's your uncle! This code will effectively remove the modal from the webpage and restore any affected functionality.
