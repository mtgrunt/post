#### Carolina Panthers (4th)
As the Carolina Panthers enter the 2024 NFL season, navigating both the promise and challenges of a major roster overhaul. The team's most significant change is the addition of quarterback Bryce Young, selected as the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. The expectations for Young are high, given his impressive college career at Alabama. His performance in early downs and under pressure will be crucial as he adapts to the professional game and seeks to stabilize a position that has been a revolving door in recent years.

The signings of Damien Lewis and Robert Hunt to significant contracts are aimed at solidifying the protection in front of Young. Both players are expected to provide stability and enhance the line’s effectiveness in both pass protection and run blocking. This upgrade is essential for a team that struggled with offensive line issues in the past and it will be critical in allowing Young to perform at his best. Additionally, the Panthers have bolstered their skill position group by trading for wide receiver Diontae Johnson and investing their first and second-round draft picks in receiver Xavier Legette and running back Jonathon Brooks. 

The Panthers’ draft selections reflect a strategic approach to building around Young. Xavier Legette, picked in the first round, offers a mix of size and athleticism, though his limited collegiate production raises some concerns. His ability to adapt quickly to the NFL will be vital for the Panthers' receiving corps. Jonathon Brooks is expected to contribute as both a runner and a receiver, complementing the team’s offensive schemes. The addition of Ja'Tavion Sanders in the fourth round provides a promising target at tight end, adding another dimension to the passing game. 

Defensively, the Panthers have made notable adjustments as well, though challenges remain. The departure of key players such as Donte Jackson, Jeremy Chinn and Vonn Bell, has created gaps in the secondary. To address these issues, the Panthers have brought in Jordan Fuller on a one-year deal. Fuller’s familiarity with defensive coordinator Ejiro Evero, who was his positional coach in Los Angeles. His partnership with Xavier Woods will be crucial in anchoring the Panthers’ secondary.

The Panthers' defense faced issues with turnovers and pass coverage last season, ranking sixth in yards allowed per attempt but struggling to force interceptions. Jaycee Horn, a key cornerback, will be a major factor. His ability to stay healthy and perform at a high level will be essential for the Panthers’ defensive success.

Overall, the Carolina Panthers are in a transitional phase with a mix of veteran acquisitions and young talent. The focus on upgrading both sides of the ball—particularly through the free agency signings and draft picks—reflects a clear strategy to build around their new franchise quarterback, Bryce Young. The success of this approach will hinge on how well the new additions integrate into the system and how quickly Young can adapt to the NFL. With significant investments in their offensive line and skill positions. Panthers are positioning themselves for a potential turnaround after a challenging few seasons. That's why I have the Panthers 4th in the NFC South.

#### New Orleans Saints (3rd)
New Orleans Saints enter the 2024 season in cap doom. Dennis Allen alongside new Offensive Coordinator Klint Kubiak is tasked with addressing several areas of concern from the previous season. Kubiak's arrival coming from the San Francisco 49ers as the pass game coordinator. His expertise in designing passing schemes and maximizing the potential of his receivers. This change is especially important as the team seeks to overcome its recent issues with red zone inefficiency and poor rushing performance.

The Saints' offensive struggles in 2023 were glaring, particularly in their rushing attack and red zone efficiency. Through the first seven weeks, the Saints ranked poorly in several key rushing metrics: 28th in early down success, 23rd in EPA per play, and 27th in yards per carry. Alvin Kamara saw a decline in his efficiency across the board. His yards per carry, explosive run rate and yards after contact per rush all dropped from previous years. This regression in Kamara's performance was a significant factor in the team's offensive struggles. 

In the red zone, the Saints showed improvement after Week 7. Early in the season, their red zone efficiency was abysmal, with a touchdown rate of just 37% from red zone drives. However, from Week 8 onward, the Saints significantly improved, scoring touchdowns on 64% of their red zone drives. This uptick in red zone performance correlated with a more effective use of multi-tight end sets. The team’s ability to adapt and find success with 12 and 13 personnel packages provides hope for a more efficient scoring strategy in 2024. That is a paper.

Despite these improvements, quarterback Derek Carr's performance was a significant concern. Through the first seven weeks of the season, Carr was among the league's worst in several critical passing metrics, including completion rate, success rate, EPA per attempt and touchdown rate. His struggles were a major factor in the Saints' offensive inefficiency. The acquisition of Spencer Rattler in the fifth round of the draft provides the team with a potential future. Rattler’s development will be something to watch, as the Saints look to secure a long-term solution at the position.

On the defensive side, the Saints have added edge rusher Chase Young to bolster their pass rush. Young, who has shown the ability to be a game-changer when healthy, will be a key addition to a defense that has generally performed well. Defensive Coordinator Ryan Nielsen, entering his second year, will be tasked with integrating Young into the defensive scheme and maximizing his impact. Nielsen’s defense will benefit from Young’s presence.

Overall, the Saints' 2024 outlook hinges on their ability to resolve several key issues from the previous season. The integration of Klint Kubiak’s offensive strategies, coupled with improvements in rushing and red zone efficiency, is critical for the team’s success. On defense, the addition of Chase Young should provide a boost, but the team will need to ensure that both their offense and defense can perform consistently throughout the season. Schedule is not kind the Saints, Week 2 through Week 6 are rough. 

#### Tampa Bay Buccaneers (2nd)
Head Coach Todd Bowles, who is entering his third year with the team. With a record of 9-8 last season and a history of unstable performance, the Bucs are at a pivotal juncture. Bowles, alongside new Offensive Coordinator Liam Coen and Defensive Coordinator Kacy Rodgers, will need to navigate a series of changes and challenges to ensure the team remains competitive in the NFC South.

The Buccaneers' 2023 season was marked by a significant variance in performance, particularly in turnover efficiency. After finishing 2022 with a dismal turnover EPA, the Bucs rebounded dramatically to become the sixth-best team in turnover EPA in 2023. This 56.8 expected points swing was a critical factor in their improved record. However, despite this positive turnover trend, Tampa Bay's performance against top teams was concerning. They faced seven teams ranked #14 or better in total efficiency and managed only a single win, suggesting issues in competing against high-caliber opponents.

One of the Bucs' major challenges moving forward will be addressing their poor rushing attack from 2023. They finished dead last in several key rushing metrics, including yards per carry, success rate and explosive run rate. The team's inability to establish a consistent ground game was compounded by questionable play-calling from then-offensive coordinator Dave Canales. The addition of Graham Barton in the first round of the draft, a promising center from Duke, should help solidify the offensive line and improve run blocking. The offensive line, while dealing with injuries and personnel changes in 2023, showed some resilience. Tristan Wirfs, who moved from right tackle to left tackle, was solid and ranked 7th in pressure rate among tackles. The Bucs lost key players like Ryan Jensen and Shaquil Barrett. Although they brought in Ben Bredeson and Randy Gregory, the overall stability of the offensive line will be under scrutiny. The performance of Luke Goedeke will also be a focal point as the Bucs aim to maintain or improve their protection for the quarterback.

Baker Mayfield's performance in 2023 was mixed. He struggled on early downs, ranking near the bottom in several metrics such as accuracy, EPA per attempt and success rate. However, he showed marked improvement in high-pressure situations, particularly on third and fourth downs, where he ranked in the top ten for accuracy, EPA per attempt and success rate. This inconsistency in performance could impact the Bucs’ ability to sustain drives and score consistently. Mayfield’s development under Coen's new system will be critical.

Wide receiver Mike Evans and Chris Godwin remain key offensive weapons for the Bucs. Evans continues to be a top target, coming off a season with over 1,200 yards and 13 touchdowns. Godwin, despite a slight dip in his numbers, remains a crucial part of the offense. The addition of Jalen McMillan from Washington should provide additional depth and competition at the wide receiver position.

Defensively, the Buccaneers will need to adapt to the loss of key players like Carlton Davis and Devin White. The addition of Jordan Whitehead and the drafting of Tykee Smith should help bolster the secondary. With Kacy Rodgers continuing as defensive coordinator, the defense must integrate these new players effectively and maintain a level of performance that can complement the offense.

Overall, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ 2024 season will hinge on their ability to address their offensive inefficiencies, particularly in the rushing game and consistency from Baker Mayfield. The defense, while dealing with some key losses, has potential for improvement with new additions. With a restructured coaching staff and key draft picks, the Bucs have the tools to compete.

#### Atlanta Falcons (1st)
Atlanta Falcons are driven by a fresh coaching staff and key roster upgrades. Under the new leadership of Head Coach Raheem Morris, formerly the defensive coordinator of the Los Angeles Rams, the Falcons are poised for a substantial shift in their defensive and offensive strategies. Morris, who played a crucial role in elevating the Rams' defensive unit, brings a promising new perspective that could drastically improve Atlanta's performance. 

The defensive overhaul extends to the coaching staff, with Jimmy Lake coming on board as the defensive coordinator. Lake, who was the assistant head coach and defensive backs coach for the Rams, brings a strong focus on defensive backfield development and a strategic mindset. This change is critical for a Falcons team that struggled with secondary coverage. Lake’s emphasis on aggressive, adaptable defensive strategies should help mitigate the weaknesses. Coupled with Morris’s overall defensive vision, Lake’s approach aims to rectify the issues that saw the Falcons falter in key moments throughout the previous year.

On the offensive side, Zac Robinson, formerly the Rams' quarterbacks coach, steps into the role of offensive coordinator. Robinson’s hiring signals a shift towards a more dynamic and high-tempo offensive system, reflective of the Rams' successful playbook. This is a strategic move to enhance the efficiency and explosiveness of the Falcons' offense, which has struggled in recent years. The addition of veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins is expected to be a game-changer. Cousins' presence addresses the Falcons' previous quarterback instability and provides a stable foundation for Robinson’s offensive scheme.

The Falcons’ offensive strategy will also be influenced by their new personnel acquisitions. The addition of Darnell Mooney, a promising wide receiver and Rondale Moore, known for his speed and playmaking ability. I don't like Mooney for WR2, but it's an upgrade as least. Aside from that, this adjustment aligns with the trends observed in successful offenses under Sean McVay’s coaching tree and should provide a more balanced and dynamic attack. The presence of standout players like Drake London and Kyle Pitts, alongside Bijan Robinson’s potential as a dynamic running back.

The 2024 draft also saw the Falcons making strategic picks to bolster their defense. Ruke Orhorhoro brings potential to the defensive line. Alongside him, Brandon Dorlus and Zion Logue are upgrades. The selection of Bralen Trice further adds depth to the edge rusher position. These additions reflect the team’s commitment to enhancing their defensive capabilities and providing a more formidable front seven to support Morris and Lake’s strategies.

Overall, the 2024 Atlanta Falcons are undergoing a significant transformation, with new coaching strategies and key roster additions aimed at addressing past shortcomings. The combination of Raheem Morris’s defensive acumen, Zac Robinson’s offensive innovation and the impactful acquisitions of Kirk Cousins and new draft picks suggests a team ready to make a marked improvement. While the risk associated with Cousins' age and recent injury is a factor, but Michael Penix Jr. is waiting in the wings.
