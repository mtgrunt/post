The Washington Commanders, who ended last season with a 4-13 record. This dismal performance enabled them to draft Jaden Daniels with the second overall pick in the 2024 NFL Entry Draft. Despite this high-profile addition, it remains unclear whether the Commanders are significantly improved compared to their 2023 version. The offseason saw some notable additions, but they also experienced substantial losses on defense. While they still retain defensive tackles Daron Payne and Jonathan Allen, the absence of edge rushers is likely to reduce their defensive effectiveness.

In addition to the defensive losses, the Commanders also lost Kyle Fuller, who was a competent cornerback and arguably their best at his position. This further diminishes their defensive capabilities. On the offensive side, Terry McLaurin remains a bright spot and there is hope that Jaden Daniels can make a substantial impact as a rookie quarterback. If Daniels performs well and the team’s draft picks are successful, the Commanders might have a chance to improve significantly. Who saw a big impact from their draft class, the Commanders could find themselves on a positive trajectory if their new players hit the ground running.

Nevertheless, the situation for the Commanders still seems grim. While they might not be as bad as they were in 2023, the loss of key defensive assets and the challenge of integrating new players make it difficult to expect a dramatic turnaround. I project a 5-12 record for the Commanders, indicating a slight improvement but still a struggle to compete at a high level. The team is in a rebuilding phase and although they’re managing their cap space well and preparing for the future.

The Dallas Cowboys, on the other hand, have declared their intent to go all-in this season under the leadership of Jerry Jones. However, the Cowboys have seen significant changes, including the loss of players such as Tyron Smith and Leighton Vander Esch. The Cowboys also face contract issues with key players Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb and Micah Parsons, all of whom are seeking new deals. Jerry Jones' concerns about a potential $4.5 billion lawsuit settlement have apparently influenced their decision-making regarding contracts and free agency.

Despite these challenges, the Cowboys still possess a talented roster with impactful players. Dak Prescott’s connection with CeeDee Lamb remains one of the NFL’s premier quarterback-receiver duos and the addition of rookie Tyler Gon should help address some of the offensive line concerns. The defense, bolstered by the return of Trayvon Diggs, should remain strong despite the loss of Vander Esch. I predict the Cowboys will finish with an 11-6 record, slightly down from their 12-5 mark in 2023. They are expected to remain competitive in the NFC, benefiting from a weaker conference compared to the AFC. However, their playoff success will be crucial in determining the long-term future of the franchise.

Excluding instances of garbage time performance, McCarthy’s 2023 team showed a marked decline in red zone efficiency compared to Moore’s 2022 squad. In 2022, the team excelled in several key metrics, including leading in bypassing third downs, early down yards per play, and third down conversion rate. In contrast, the 2023 team fell significantly short, ranking 18th in bypassing third downs, 18th in early down yards per play, and 20th in third down conversion rate. McCarthy’s strategy lacked a sufficient emphasis on avoiding third downs, which was evident from the team’s dismal #28 ranking in red zone touchdown rate through the first five weeks.

To address these issues, I’ve proposed several strategic adjustments for the Cowboys. They should reduce their early down run rate to create more opportunities for passing plays. Second, increasing the use of 2-tight end sets on pass plays could help improve their red zone effectiveness. Third, incorporating more designed runs for Dak Prescott and encouraging him to scramble could provide additional offensive options. Finally, decreasing Rico Dowdle’s role as a short-yardage back might help optimize the team’s red zone performance. Implementing these changes could potentially reverse the current trend and enhance the team’s overall efficiency in scoring situations.

The Philadelphia Eagles present a more complex picture for the 2024 season. The roster is highly talented, with the team having reached the Super Bowl in the 2022 season and starting the 2023 season strongly. However, their performance declined significantly in the latter half of 2023. Jalen Hurts experienced a dip in form and the team lost key veterans like Jason Kelce and Fletcher Cox. The Eagles' performance in 2024 will hinge on whether they can regain their earlier form or continue the struggles seen late last season.

The Eagles’ secondary experienced a sharp decline in 2023, finishing 27th in EPA per dropback allowed, largely due to a significant drop in defensive metrics compared to 2022. In 2022, the defense allowed 9.5 air yards per attempt, had a time-to-throw of 2.67 seconds and saw 30% of attempts with the ball held for 3+ seconds, with a 17% rate of throws at or behind the line of scrimmage. However, in 2023, these numbers worsened considerably: air yards per attempt dropped to 7.5, time-to-throw increased to 3.04 seconds, 39% of attempts saw the ball held for 3+ seconds and throws at or behind the line of scrimmage rose to 25%. To counteract these issues, the Eagles' front office made strategic moves, including re-signing C.J. Gardner-Johnson, drafting Quinyon Mitchell in the first round and adding Cooper DeJean in the second. Gardner-Johnson is coming off a season cut short by injury, and it remains uncertain how quickly Mitchell and DeJean will adapt to the NFL.

Despite these defensive challenges, there is optimism surrounding the Eagles' upcoming season, thanks in part to a favorable schedule. The team faces the ninth-easiest schedule overall, with their slate of run defenses easing further from Week 7 onward. This bodes well for Saquon Barkley, one of the major offseason acquisitions, who is expected to benefit from the improved run-blocking of his new team. The Giants' run-blocking performance was poor, ranking 31st in 2023 and 26th in 2022, with a significant drop in their run-block win percentage according to ESPN. In contrast, the Eagles’ run-block win percentage has been impressive, ranking 1st in 2023 and 2nd in 2022. The addition of Barkley, combined with a strong offensive line, positions him to capitalize on the Eagles’ favorable run-blocking conditions.

The Eagles have made changes to their coaching staff, hiring Kellen Moore and Vic Fangio to replace the previous offensive and defensive coordinators. Both Moore and Fangio bring established track records that could benefit the Eagles. Additionally, the team has strengthened its roster with the addition of Saquon Barkley and improvements to the secondary. These moves aim to address past weaknesses and enhance overall team balance. Given their talent and these strategic improvements, I predict the Eagles will finish with an 11-6 record, similar to the Cowboys.

The final team in the NFC East is the New York Giants, who present a stark contrast to the Cowboys and Eagles. While the Cowboys and Eagles have strong rosters and potential Super Bowl aspirations, the Giants appear to be in a more challenging situation. They finished 6-11 last season after making the playoffs the year before. Despite having some promising defensive players like Dexter Lawrence and Brian Burns, the Giants' overall roster lacks depth and impact.

The Giants have some potential with players like Malik Neighbors and their recent trade acquisitions, but the team is still in a rebuilding phase. The uncertainty around Daniel Jones’ future and the lack of significant offensive upgrades suggest that the Giants are not positioned for immediate success. With the team potentially focusing on the 2025 quarterback class, the 2024 season might be a tough one for the Giants. I project a 3-14 record for them, one of the lowest in the NFL, reflecting the difficulties they face in both offense and overall team performance.

In summary, for the NFC East, I have the Philadelphia Eagles finishing first and the Dallas Cowboys second, both with an 11-6 record. Despite their identical records, the Eagles edge out the Cowboys based on head-to-head matchups and tiebreakers. Both teams are expected to make the playoffs, while the Commanders and Giants will struggle. The Commanders are forecasted to finish third with a 5-12 record, and the Giants are predicted to be last with a 3-14 record. This outlook aligns with the historical trend of the NFC East, where different teams have won the division each year since the NFL expanded to 32 teams in 2002.
