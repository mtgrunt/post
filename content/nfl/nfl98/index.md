#### Seattle Seahawks (4th)
The Seattle Seahawks are gearing up for the 2024 season under new head coach Mike Macdonald, who has wasted no time in setting ambitious goals for the team. Emphasizing a return to their defensive roots and physical dominance up front. Where they focused on bolstering both the offensive and defensive lines to lay the foundation for a robust, Ravens-inspired style of play from day one.

Under new O.C. Ryan Grubb. Grubb brings a college-inspired emphasis on tempo and efficiency. The goal is clear: to stress opposing defenses with quicker decision-making and more dynamic play-calling. Moreover, translating into improved scoring opportunities and red zone efficiency. While these plans are promising, it's on paper now. Additionally, Grubb is farfetched to employ a bunch of two tight-end sets. 

The Seahawks’ 2024 draft class also holds promise, with standout defensive prospect Byron Murphy leading the charge. Murphy’s ability to disrupt opposing offenses from the interior adds depth and potential impact to Seattle’s defensive line. With competition for starting roles heating up among established veterans, Murphy’s presence signals a competitive push within the team. 

Overall, the Seahawks’ 2024 season is poised to be a transformative one and the integration of promising new talent. As they navigate the challenges of adapting to new coaching philosophies and integrating fresh faces into the lineup, but I feel like it's over the top to say the coaches and players will be gelled in Week One. Therefore, I predict 4th in NFC West. It's a tough NFC West 2024.

#### Arizona Cardinals (3rd)
Heading into the 2024 season, the Arizona Cardinals are focused on addressing defensive deficiencies that have held them back in recent years. With key draft picks like Darius Robinson on the defensive line and Max Melton at cornerback. 'Zona have made significant moves to bolster their defensive unit under H.C. Gannon. The effectiveness of these additions will be crucial as they aim to shore up their defense and compete in a tough NFC West division.

Offensively, much hinges on the performance and availability of quarterback Kyler Murray. Despite concerns about his consistency in recent seasons, Murray remains pivotal to the Cardinals’ success. That said, Murray will get $49M in 2024 alone. Under offensive coordinator Drew Petzing, the Cardinals showed improvement in their rushing attack last season. Boasting impressive statistics in yards per carry, success rate and explosive run plays once Murray returned to full health. The challenge for Petzing and the offensive coaching staff will be to maintain their offensive strategies to maximize Murray’s talents and mitigate any potential durability issues.

2024 season will heavily rely on how well they can capitalize on their offensive improvements, integrate their new defensive talent and Murray. As they continue to refine their roster and game plans heading into the season. Cardinals’ ability to navigate challenges and execute their strategic vision will ultimately determine their success in the upcoming campaign. I'm going out on a limb, 'Zona will be third in the NFC West.

#### Los Angeles Rams (2nd)
As the Los Angeles Rams prepare for the 2024 season, head coach Sean McVay has taken proactive steps to refine their offensive approach. Following a season where adjustments were crucial to their success, McVay focused on reducing target depths on early downs. Also, increasing usage of play-action passes and incorporating more motion into their offensive schemes. These changes are designed to enhance efficiency and keep defenses guessing, especially crucial given the tough schedule of top pass defenses they will face this season.

On the defensive side, Chris Shula steps up to the role of defensive coordinator with a mandate to improve upon last year's performance. The Rams invested heavily in their defense during the draft, selecting five defensive players in their first six picks. First-round pick Jared Verse is expected to bolster the pass rush opposite standout Byron Young. I'm raving about third-round pick; Kamren Kinchens playmaking ability to the secondary. With a blend of experienced veterans and promising rookies, the Rams aim to build a formidable defense that complements their high-powered offense.

Quarterback Matthew Stafford enters the season with renewed confidence following adjustments that saw his efficiency increase dramatically in the latter half of last year. With a reduced shotgun rate and more reliance on play-action, Stafford's ability to connect with a receiving corps led by stars like Puka Nucua and Cooper Kupp. With McVay's strategic acumen and Stafford's veteran leadership, the Rams are poised to compete at a high level in a competitive NFC West. It'll be a fight at the end of the season between theRams and the 49ers. 

    Team        Personnel
    Cardinals   11(64%) 12(20%) 13(11.5%)
    Rams        11(95%) 12(5%)
    49ers       11(38%) 21(36%) 12(13%) 22(11%)
    Seahawks    11(63%) 12(22%) 13(10%)
Obviously, new coaches and new schemes for the Seattle Seahawks. My predication is an uptick for the offensive Seahawks.

#### San Francisco 49ers (1st)
Heading into the 2024 season, the San Francisco 49ers are looking to build upon their successful campaign last year. Head coach, Kyle Shanahan's innovative offensive schemes have been a cornerstone of their success, consistently adapting to maximize the talents of his roster. 49ers offensively in 11, 12, 21 and 22 personnel sets highlights Shanahan's ability to create mismatches and exploit defenses, ranking at the top in various offensive metrics.

Defensively, the 49ers are poised to maintain their strength with strategic additions. Despite some weaknesses in generating pre-snap penalties and holding calls, they have bolstered their defensive line. 49ers added Leonard Floyd, Maliek Collins and Yetur Gross-Matos. These additions complement the return of key players like Nick Bosa, ensuring a formidable defensive front that can pressure quarterbacks and disrupt opposing offenses. Last year, 49ers defensive running schemes were nonviable, at times. This defensive depth will be critical as they navigate a competitive NFC West division and aim to secure their place atop the standings.

Looking ahead, the 49ers' success in the 2024 season will hinge on maintaining their health, executing Shanahan's diverse offensive strategies and leveraging their sturdy defense. With aspirations to not just return to the Super Bowl but to win it, the 49ers under Shanahan's leadership are well-positioned to contend in a playoff-run, again. Rams are legit within their division, I'm hoping the 49ers ability to perform consistently at a high level. The main goal is determining their chances in the playoffs and the Super Bowl, bar none.
