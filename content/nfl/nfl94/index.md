#### Kansas City Chiefs (1)
In 2023, the Kansas City Chiefs continued their dominant trajectory, culminating in their third Super Bowl victory in five years under the leadership of Head Coach Andy Reid. Despite Patrick Mahomes' somewhat off-season, marked by career lows in several key metrics such as touchdown rate and yards per pass attempt, the Chiefs excelled where it mattered most. They navigated a challenging year with a revamped receiving corps that was notably less experienced, relying heavily on Marquez Valdes-Scantling and rookie Rashee Rice. The team’s conservative passing game—ranking last in air yards per attempt and deep throws—suggested a strategic shift toward a more methodical approach, leveraging short and screen passes to maximize efficiency.

The Chiefs faced significant changes in 2023, including a notable shake-up in their wide receiver room and offensive line. The loss of key players like Mecole Hardman and Donovan Smith was mitigated by strategic acquisitions and draft picks. Kansas City invested heavily in bolstering their roster, signing key free agents such as Marquise Brown and Irv Smith Jr., and drafting promising talents like Xavier Worthy and Jared Wiley. Xavier Worthy could be a primary receiver for the Chiefs if Marquise Brown is still hurt in the early season. 

Looking ahead to 2024, the Chiefs are well-positioned to continue their success with a stronger and more versatile receiving corps. The additions of Marquise Brown and Xavier Worthy, alongside their investments in tight ends, aim to address the previous season's limitations and provide Mahomes with more dynamic options. The team’s front office has demonstrated a clear strategy in addressing their needs through both free agency and the draft, ensuring that Mahomes has the support necessary to return to peak performance. The revamped roster should offer increased depth and playmaking ability, enhancing the Chiefs' offensive efficiency and allowing them to better capitalize on their high-powered scheme.

Defensively, the Chiefs remain anchored by Defensive Coordinator Steve Spagnuolo’s experience and the stability of their established defensive core. The loss of L'Jarius Sneed and Willie Gay, Jr., though significant, is countered by the addition of new talent through the draft and free agency. The team’s focus on bolstering their defense will be crucial, especially in maintaining their competitive edge in the highly contested AFC. With an improved receiving corps and strategic roster enhancements, the Chiefs are set up to continue their dominance and remain a formidable force in the NFL.

#### Los Angeles Chargers (2)
Jim Harbaugh was a phenomenal coach in Ann Arbor at Michigan University, San Francisco 49ers and Stanford Cardinal. I feel like one or two years down the road, he will be in first place in the West. Andy Reid will retire. In 2023, the Los Angeles Chargers navigated a challenging season marked by significant roster changes and injuries. Head Coach Brandon Staley’s tenure continued to face scrutiny as the team's defense struggled, finishing 28th in overall rankings—mirroring their previous years of defensive difficulties. The Chargers’ offense was also impacted by injuries, notably affecting key players like Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, who both spent significant time on the sideline. Despite these setbacks, the team attempted to maintain competitiveness, but the issues on both sides of the ball hindered their overall performance and consistency.

Heading into 2024, the Chargers have undergone a substantial overhaul with the introduction of new leadership. Former Michigan Head Coach Jim Harbaugh takes the helm, bringing his established track record of success, while Greg Roman joins as Offensive Coordinator and Jesse Minter as Defensive Coordinator. This new coaching staff is expected to bring a fresh approach to both sides of the ball. Roman’s offensive philosophy, which emphasizes a run-heavy scheme, complements Harbaugh’s history of successful team management and tactical innovation. Their prior collaboration in San Francisco is expected to influence the Chargers' offensive strategy significantly.

To address their needs and bolster their roster, the Chargers made several key acquisitions and draft picks. They signed free agents such as Will Dissly and Gus Edwards, aiming to strengthen their depth at tight end and running back. The draft also brought in valuable assets, including Joe Alt, a highly touted offensive tackle from Notre Dame, who will likely play a crucial role in solidifying the offensive line. Additionally, Ladd McConkey, a wide receiver from Georgia, was drafted to help mitigate the loss of Allen and Williams and to enhance the receiving corps alongside Quentin Johnston and Josh Palmer.

Looking ahead, the 2024 season represents a pivotal opportunity for the Chargers to recalibrate and capitalize on their strategic changes. The focus will be on implementing a more balanced and efficient offensive approach while improving defensive performance under Minter’s guidance. The addition of key draft picks and free agents should address some of the team’s previous shortcomings, particularly in offensive line protection and playmaking depth. If Harbaugh and his new coaching staff can effectively integrate these changes and maintain player health, the Chargers are poised for a rebound and potential resurgence in a highly competitive AFC.

#### Denver Broncos (3)
In 2023, the Denver Broncos struggled through a tumultuous season under Head Coach Sean Payton, who was in his first year with the team. Despite high expectations following the $243 million contract given to Russell Wilson, the Broncos experienced severe inconsistency. Denver started the season poorly, with a 1-5 record, narrowly escaping an 0-6 start by pulling off a comeback victory against the Bears. Wilson’s performance, while statistically impressive in several metrics, did not translate to wins. 

Defensively, the Broncos faced significant challenges. They ranked dead last in several key metrics, including points allowed, EPA/play and yards/play. This defensive ineptitude was a major factor in the team’s struggles, contributing to their inability to win games despite occasional strong performances on offense. The defense's poor performance was exacerbated by injuries and inconsistent play from key players, including Pat Surtain. The Broncos' defensive issues were compounded by a lack of depth and effectiveness in key positions.

As the Broncos look ahead to the 2024 season, they have made some notable changes to their roster and coaching staff. Offensive Coordinator Joe Lombardi and Defensive Coordinator Vance Joseph join Payton in their first year with the team. Key players like Jerry Jeudy, Justin Simmons, Lloyd Cushenberry, Josey Jewell and K'Waun Williams have departed. The Broncos have also made several draft picks, including quarterback Bo Nix, who will compete with Russell Wilson and potentially offer a new direction for the offense. The team’s schedule is projected to be more manageable, with one of the easier paths in terms of facing opposing offenses.

Looking ahead, the Broncos' success in 2024 will largely depend on how effectively they integrate their new acquisitions and adapt to the changes in their roster. Bo Nix’s potential fit into Payton’s system could be a key factor, as could the performance of the new additions in the backfield and the wide receiving corps. The Broncos will need to address their defensive weaknesses, particularly in run defense and pass coverage, to become more competitive. With a slightly easier schedule and improved depth. Much will hinge on their ability to execute and adapt to the evolving demands of the season.

#### Las Vegas Raiders (4)
In 2023, the Las Vegas Raiders experienced a season marked by transition and inconsistency. Antonio Pierce, taking over the reins and a revamped coaching staff including Offensive Coordinator Luke Getsy, the team faced significant changes. Despite these shifts, the Raiders struggled to achieve consistent success, finishing below expectations. A notable issue was the performance of their quarterbacks, with rookie Aidan O'Connell showing better efficiency metrics compared to veteran Jimmy Garoppolo, though neither was able to lead the team to a winning record. The team’s schedule featured several favorable matchups against backup quarterbacks, which offered some respite but ultimately did not translate into a significantly improved record.

The Raiders' roster saw substantial changes as well, with key players such as Hunter Renfrow, Josh Jacobs and Bilal Nichols departing. Renfrow's exit, in particular, left a gap in the receiving corps, which now relies heavily on Davante Adams and Jakobi Meyers. The running back position is another area of concern following Jacobs' move to the Packers. Zamir White, with his physical running style, is expected to fill the void left by Jacobs, but his effectiveness compared to Jacobs remains to be seen. The Raiders also signed several free agents, including defensive tackle Christian Wilkins and quarterback Gardner Minshew, aiming to address gaps in their roster and bolster their competitive edge.

For the 2024 season, the Raiders have a new sense of optimism under Pierce’s leadership, with the hope that his coaching style will bring a new energy to the team. The addition of players like Brock Bowers at tight end and a potential breakout year for Tre Tucker could provide much-needed depth and playmaking ability. However, the team’s success will largely depend on the development of key players and the ability of the new coaching staff to effectively implement their strategies. The shift in offensive philosophy, driven by Pierce’s vision and White’s running style, suggests a move towards a more physical and ground-oriented attack.

Defensively, the Raiders are expected to benefit from the continuity provided by Defensive Coordinator Patrick Graham, who enters his third year with the team. The addition of Christian Wilkins should strengthen the interior defensive line, addressing a critical need from the previous season. Despite these improvements, the Raiders will need to address lingering concerns in their secondary and overall defensive consistency to improve their standing in a competitive AFC West. With a mix of new talent and returning key players, the Raiders are poised to build on their 2023 experiences and aim for a more successful 2024 campaign.
