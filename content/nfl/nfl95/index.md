#### Detroit Lions (1)
Ben Johnson faced a tough challenge to keep the offense performing well, especially with a defense that struggled last season. The Detroit Lions started the 2023 season strongly with a 5-1 record, a big improvement from their 1-5 start in 2022. Despite having a well-performing offense in the first half of games, with top ranks in points, yards per play, and efficiency metrics, the team still needed to address critical issues. One of the main concerns was that their defense wasn’t able to support the offense consistently.

The Lions' offense was impressive in the first half of games last year, ranking highly in several key metrics such as yards per attempt and yards per carry. They were efficient early on, scoring 250 points in the first half and leading in 13 out of 15 games. However, the team’s fourth-quarter performance was often crucial due to two main problems: a poor defense and ineffective offensive strategies in the third quarter. Ideally, the defense should have thrived when opponents were forced to pass in desperation, but that was not the case.

To address these issues, Detroit made significant moves in the offseason. They acquired D.J. Reader from the Bengals, a player known for his strong run defense and improved pass rush. Reader’s impact was evident in his previous team’s defensive stats, where the Bengals ranked first in run defense with him on the field and fell to the bottom of the league when he was absent. Adding Reader was expected to strengthen the Lions’ defense, particularly against the run, and help create more pressure on opposing quarterbacks.

Detroit also made strategic changes to their secondary by trading for cornerback Carlton Davis and drafting Terrion Arnold and Ennis Rakestraw. These moves were crucial for improving a defense that was solid against the run but weak against the pass. With a potentially easier schedule of defenses in 2024 and improvements in both the defense and secondary, the Lions are well-positioned to build on their successful offensive performance and address the challenges they faced last season.

#### Green Bay Packers (2)
In the 2023 NFL season, the Packers experienced a dramatic turnaround from their earlier struggles. After starting with a disappointing 2-5 record, the team adapted their offensive strategies, leading them to a strong finish and a Divisional Round playoff appearance. This significant improvement came despite facing the second-toughest schedule of offenses in 2024. The key to their revival was the effectiveness of adjustments made by Matt LaFleur and his staff. 

The Packers' offensive struggles in the early part of the season were not due to a lack of talent among players like Jordan Love, Christian Watson, or Romeo Doubs. Instead, the problems lay in the team's offensive philosophy and strategy. Initially, Green Bay had a poor goal-to-go touchdown rate and struggled to generate explosive plays, which negatively impacted their drive statistics. However, the team's fortunes changed once they incorporated more explosive plays. Plus, leading to a marked improvement in points per drive, red zone efficiency and overall offensive effectiveness.

To address their depth issues, the Packers made strategic moves in the off-season. They signed running back Josh Jacobs and drafted key players like Jordan Morgan, Edgerrin Cooper, Javon Bullard, MarShawn Lloyd and Ty'Ron Hopper. These additions were aimed at bolstering their roster and addressing specific needs, particularly in enhancing the offensive line and securing more explosive play capabilities. Morgan, although an unconventional pick as a first-round offensive tackle, was expected to contribute significantly despite concerns about his fit.

The Packers' 2023 season was characterized by a significant transformation, highlighting the importance of adaptability in football. Their ability to pivot from a struggling start to a playoff-caliber finish underscores the effectiveness of strategic adjustments and the impact of making the right personnel moves. Facing a 2024 tougher schedule, the team’s focus will likely be on building on the lessons learned and continuing to refine their approach to maintain their competitive edge.

#### Chicago Bears (3)
As the Chicago Bears head into the 2024 NFL season, they are making significant changes to their coaching staff and roster. Matt Eberflus returns for his third year as head coach, but the team has brought in new coordinators: Shane Waldron from the Seattle Seahawks as the Offensive Coordinator and Eric Washington, formerly of the Buffalo Bills, as the Defensive Coordinator. These changes signal a fresh approach on both sides of the ball, especially as the Bears face a challenging schedule against the NFC North, AFC South, and NFC West divisions.

The Bears have made notable moves in the off-season to bolster their team. They acquired veteran wide receiver Keenan Allen through a trade and signed key free agents including running back D'Andre Swift, safety Kevin Byard, tight end Gerald Everett, and center Ryan Bates. Additionally, they focused on the draft, selecting quarterback Caleb Williams with the first overall pick, wide receiver Rome Odunze at No. 9, and offensive tackle Kiran Amegadjie in the third round. These additions are designed to enhance the team’s performance and address various weaknesses from last season.

Despite having a quarterback in the third year of his rookie deal, the Bears had the seventh cheapest offense and the tenth cheapest defense in 2023. The team’s struggles were highlighted by their high sack count, giving up 50 total sacks against a relatively easy schedule of defenses. While they did see some improvement in sack rates and pressure metrics after acquiring Montez Sweat, the Bears will need a more effective pass rush and better overall offensive efficiency to compete effectively this season.

Last year, the Bears showed some progress in their offensive efficiency, particularly on early downs. Quarterback Justin Fields was noted for holding onto the ball longer than most, which contributed to high sack numbers. With Caleb Williams expected to reduce mistakes and the addition of Keenan Allen and Rome Odunze to an already impressive receiving corps, including D.J. Moore and Cole Kmet, the Bears aim to become more competitive. The signing of D’Andre Swift also addresses their need for a reliable receiving back, rounding out their efforts to build a more balanced and dynamic offense for the upcoming season.

#### Minnesota Vikings (4)
The Minnesota Vikings are gearing up for the 2024 NFL season with a mix of change and continuity. Head Coach Kevin O’Connell and Offensive Coordinator Wes Phillips return for their second year, but the team has brought in Brian Flores as the new Defensive Coordinator. The Vikings face a significant transition this season with key departures, including quarterback Kirk Cousins, edge rushers Danielle Hunter, Marcus Davenport, D.J. Wonnum and linebacker Jordan Hicks. Their replacements and new acquisitions aim to reshape the roster and address the losses from last year.

The Vikings have made several notable moves in free agency, signing edge rushers Jonathan Greenard, Andrew Van Ginkel, Sam Darnold, Aaron Jones and Shaquill Griffin. Additionally, they have bolstered their roster through the draft by selecting quarterback J.J. McCarthy, edge rusher Dallas Turner and cornerback Khyree Jackson. The transition from Kirk Cousins to J.J. McCarthy is a significant shift, as McCarthy's inexperience at the NFL level may lead to some growing pains. Sam Darnold could see extended playing time if McCarthy struggles early on.

The Vikings' 2023 season was marked by a lack of fourth-quarter magic, a stark contrast to their impressive 2022 performance. They struggled in close games, going 1-4 in one-score contests through Week 5 and only managing a narrow win against the Chicago Bears. This season, the Vikings face the projected fifth-hardest schedule but benefit from the second-highest net rest advantage with +12 days compared to their opponents. This schedule and rest advantage might help them navigate their transitional period.

Despite the changes, the Vikings still boast a dynamic offense. Justin Jefferson, even with limited games due to injury, continued to be a standout performer and Jordan Addison demonstrated his potential by stepping up during Jefferson's absence. With the addition of Aaron Jones, the Vikings aim to maintain their offensive firepower. As they adapt to a new quarterback and integrate their new acquisitions. Vikings will need to find consistency and make the most of their strengths to compete effectively in a challenging division and conference.
