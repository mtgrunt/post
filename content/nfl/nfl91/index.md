#### Baltimore Ravens (1)
In the 2023 NFL season, the Baltimore Ravens demonstrated a potent combination of offensive efficiency and defensive prowess. The Ravens' offense, spearheaded by MVP quarterback Lamar Jackson, excelled with a career-high 8 yards per pass attempt and a 5.3% touchdown rate. Jackson's dual-threat capability was evident as he also accumulated 821 rushing yards and five touchdowns, contributing significantly to the Ravens' high ranking in yards per play (4th) and points per drive (6th). The team's offensive efficiency was highlighted by a remarkable opening drive touchdown rate of 42.1%, a significant improvement from the previous seasons. However, the Ravens' defense, despite being dominant in pressure and sack metrics, faced challenges with run defense, ranking 27th in yards allowed per carry.

As the Ravens head into the 2024 season, several notable changes have impacted both their coaching staff and player roster. Head Coach John Harbaugh continues his long tenure, now entering his 17th season, with Todd Monken stepping in as the offensive coordinator for his second year and Zachary Orr taking over as the defensive coordinator. Key departures include linebacker Patrick Queen, guard John Simpson and edge rusher Jadeveon Clowney. The Ravens have also lost key contributors such as Geno Stone, Kevin Zeitler and J.K. Dobbins, with some of them signing with rival teams or joining new franchises.

To address these gaps, the Ravens made strategic moves in the draft and free agency. They added high-potential rookies, including cornerback Nate Wiggins from Clemson and offensive tackle Roger Rosengarten from Washington. The team also signed free-agent running back Derrick Henry, despite his recent decline in explosive run metrics. Henry’s addition could provide a boost, particularly in forcing defenses to stack the box, which may benefit Jackson's passing game. On the defensive side, the Ravens bolstered their edge rush with the addition of Adisa Isaac, aiming to replace some of the production lost with Clowney's departure.

Looking ahead to the 2024 season, the Ravens' schedule presents a mix of challenges and opportunities. Their strength of schedule will be tougher compared to 2023, potentially testing their depth and adaptability. The Ravens' weekly betting lines will reflect their need to navigate these challenges, especially given the adjustments in their roster. With Lamar Jackson continuing to be a central figure and the defense expected to adapt under new leadership, the Ravens are positioned for another competitive season, though success will hinge on how well they integrate their new personnel and manage their evolving roster dynamics.

#### Cincinnati Bengals (2)
In the 2023 NFL season, the Cincinnati Bengals faced a challenging year marked by injury and inconsistency. The team finished with a 9-8 record, a drop from their previous season’s 12-5 performance. Quarterback Joe Burrow, who suffered a calf strain during training camp and later a wrist injury, struggled to maintain his previous level of play. His injury issues led to uneven offensive production and despite a strong outing in Week 5, the Bengals’ performance remained inconsistent. Offensive Coordinator Brian Callahan, along with Head Coach Zac Taylor, noted the need for improvement in scoring efficiency. The Bengals’ offense was plagued by struggles, particularly in finding rhythm and consistency, resulting in a midseason reevaluation of their strategies.

Heading into the 2024 season, the Bengals have undergone several significant roster changes. Key players such as left tackle Jonah Williams, cornerback Chidobe Awuzie and defensive tackle D.J. Reader have left the team, impacting both the offensive line and defensive front. Joe Mixon, the primary running back, was traded to the Texans and Tyler Boyd, a reliable wide receiver, also departed. These losses have prompted the Bengals to make strategic acquisitions and draft picks to address their needs. The team drafted Amarius Mims, an offensive tackle from Georgia and Kris Jenkins, a defensive tackle from Michigan, aiming to strengthen both the offensive line and the defensive front.

The Bengals' 2024 draft and free agency moves reflect a strategic approach to rebuilding and bolstering their roster. Mims, though raw, is expected to develop into a crucial piece of the offensive line, learning from veterans like Orlando Brown Jr. and Trent Brown. Kris Jenkins and McKinnley Jackson, both drafted to bolster the defensive line, especially with the departure of D.J. Reader. The signing of Sheldon Rankins adds depth to the defensive line, although his focus is more on pass-rushing than run defense. Additionally, the Bengals acquired Zack Moss to strengthen their running back corps and Geno Stone to shore up the safety position.

As the Bengals prepare for the 2024 season, several key factors will determine their success. Joe Burrow’s health is paramount; if he can remain injury-free, the team is poised for a strong playoff push. The defense faces challenges with new personnel filling significant roles. The Bengals’ ability to adapt their defensive schemes and integrate new players will be crucial. The revamped roster, combined with Burrow’s potential return to form, provides optimism for a bounce-back season. If the team can address their defensive weaknesses and maintain offensive consistency, they have the potential to contend strongly in the upcoming season.

#### Cleveland Browns (3)
The Cleveland Browns experienced a notable rebound in the 2023 NFL season, finishing with an 11-6 record, a significant improvement from their previous years. Despite a strong regular-season finish, the team faced considerable adversity. Quarterback Deshaun Watson struggled with injuries throughout the season, including a displaced shoulder fracture that sidelined him for multiple games. His inconsistency, combined with a severe knee injury to Pro Bowl running back Nick Chubb in Week 2, forced the Browns to navigate a challenging season with frequent quarterback changes and a reconfigured backfield. Despite these hurdles, the Browns’ defense, led by Myles Garrett and a formidable pass rush.

Heading into the 2024 season, the Browns have made several strategic moves to bolster their roster. Key departures include Joe Flacco, Jordan Elliott, Sione Takitaki, Harrison Bryant, Nick Harris and Mike Ford. In response, the team has signed free agents like Jameis Winston and Jordan Hicks. They have added defensive tackle Quinton Jefferson. The draft brought in Michael Hall Jr., a promising defensive tackle from Ohio State, and Zak Zinter, an offensive guard from Michigan. The Browns’ approach reflects a focus on both immediate needs and future potential.

The Browns’ offensive strategies and play-calling are set to undergo evaluation in 2024. With Kevin Stefanski still at the helm and Ken Dorsey as the new offensive coordinator, the team is expected to refine their approach, particularly in balancing their use of 11 personnel. In 2023, the Browns leaned heavily on this formation, but improvements in early-down production and play-action efficiency are necessary. Deshaun Watson’s performance remains a critical factor; his $63.8 million cap hit underscores the need for him to return to his Houston form. The offensive line, bolstered by new draft picks and free-agent additions, will play a pivotal role in protecting Watson and supporting the run game, especially with Chubb’s return in question.

Defensively, the Browns remain strong with a core of returning players and key additions. Myles Garrett continues to be a dominant force, complemented by Za'Darius Smith and a solid linebacker corps that now includes Jordan Hicks and Devin Bush. The secondary, anchored by Denzel Ward and supported by Martin Emerson and Greg Newsome, was instrumental in the Browns' top-ranked pass defense. The additions of Michael Hall Jr. and Quinton Jefferson aim to enhance the defensive line's depth, addressing the loss of Jordan Elliott. With these adjustments, the Browns look to build on their defensive success and address their offensive challenges, setting the stage for a competitive 2024 season.

#### Pittsburgh Steelers (4)
In the 2023 NFL season, the Pittsburgh Steelers showed modest improvement with a 10-7 record. The team struggled offensively, ranking at the bottom in several key metrics, including yards per drive: points scored per game and points per minute of possession. This underperformance led to significant changes in the coaching staff, with Arthur Smith coming in as the new offensive coordinator to address the anemic offensive output. Despite these issues, the defense remained a strong suit for the Steelers, finishing 11th in pressure rate and 47 sacks, largely driven by the exceptional play of T.J. Watt, who led the league with 19 sacks.

Heading into the 2024 season, the Steelers are undergoing notable changes in their roster and coaching staff. Head Coach Mike Tomlin continues his impressive tenure, now in his 17th year, while Arthur Smith replaces Matt Canada as offensive coordinator, bringing a new perspective to the team's offensive strategies. On the defensive side, Teryl Austin remains as coordinator, focusing on maintaining the defensive strength that has been a hallmark of the team. The Steelers have made several key roster moves, including the loss of Diontae Johnson to the Panthers, Patrick Peterson to an unspecified team and Mason Cole to an unknown destination. Notable additions include quarterback Russell Wilson and linebacker Patrick Queen, who are expected to play pivotal roles in their respective areas.

The Steelers’ draft and free agency strategies reflect a focus on strengthening both the offensive line and defensive front. They selected Troy Fautanu and Zach Frazier in the early rounds, aiming to bolster their offensive line, which has been a long-standing area of concern. Fautanu’s versatility is expected to address their immediate need at tackle, while Frazier is anticipated to secure the center position. Additionally, Roman Wilson and Payton Wilson add depth at wide receiver and linebacker, respectively. The team's decision to trade for Justin Fields and Donte Jackson highlights a commitment to improving both the quarterback position and the secondary, addressing gaps left by departing players.

The Steelers’ offensive and defensive strategies will be under close scrutiny in 2024. Russell Wilson’s acquisition is a significant gamble; despite his past success, his 2023 performance showed a tendency to hold the ball too long and focus on deep throws, which could impact the Steelers’ offensive rhythm. The offensive line’s overhaul, with new faces like Fautanu and Frazier, will be crucial in providing better protection and creating running lanes for Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. On defense, the Steelers aim to build on their solid 2023 performance by integrating Patrick Queen into the linebacker core and leveraging the playmaking abilities of T.J. Watt and emerging talents like Joey Porter Jr. With these adjustments, the Steelers are positioned to address their previous shortcomings and compete more effectively in the 2024 season.
