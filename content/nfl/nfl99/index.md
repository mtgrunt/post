Key Points to Consider:

Tough Schedule: Facing the #1 most difficult schedule of offenses implies they'll be up against some of the top offensive teams in the league. This includes road games against formidable opponents like the Bills, 49ers, Packers, and Dolphins within the first eight weeks. These teams typically have strong offenses led by talented quarterbacks and skill position players.

Defensive Challenges: With a new defensive coordinator in Nick Rallis and potentially new defensive schemes under Jonathan Gannon, the Cardinals will need to quickly adapt and gel as a unit to effectively counter these high-powered offenses. The adjustments and chemistry-building process might take time which could impact their performance early in the season.

Offensive Adjustments: On the offensive side, the loss of key players like D.J. Humphries and Marquise Brown will require the remaining offensive players to step up, including newcomers like Jonah Williams and Marvin Harrison Jr. They'll need to quickly establish chemistry and effectiveness to keep pace with opponents.

Overall Forecast Adjustment: Considering these factors, the projection of 6 wins for the season could potentially be optimistic given the challenging schedule and the adjustments required across both offense and defense. The early road games against strong opponents will be crucial in setting the tone for their season.

Development and Progress: The development of younger players and how quickly they integrate into their respective roles will be pivotal. The coaching staff's ability to adapt and make necessary adjustments throughout the season will play a significant role in their overall success.

In summary, while the Cardinals have made some notable additions and have potential in their roster. Combination of a tough schedule and adjustments needed across the board suggests that their 2024 season might be another challenging one.
