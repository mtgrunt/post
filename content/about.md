ðŸ‘‹ Hello. Bonjour. Hallo. Hola. Konnichiwa.

I'm Miles from California. I create easy and fun to follow content on my website. I try to share what Iâ€™m learning at the moment. Generally, I code HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python. Another than that, I programmed my new website and it's Hugo. I coded my Django website and I programmed various apps and websites for Django 4.0. I assisted in an old Grand Theft Auto 5 mod. and a server. My goal is to combine creative thinking and design with an appproach to solve problems at the intersection of technology. Also, I'm a fan of the 49ers and I have a passion for schemes and statistics. For more details, information and updates you can find me on GitHub. https://github.com/mtgrunt
